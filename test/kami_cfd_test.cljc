  "Tests ported 1:1 from the original Rust `#[test]`s in the kami-engine-cfd
  Rust crate (`tests/drag.rs`, `tests/drag3d.rs`, `tests/mesh.rs` — 8 tests,
  ~118 lines total), restored as portable CLJC per ADR-2607010930 / the
  repo-wide Rust-demotion policy. See `kami-cfd`/`kami-cfd.d3` namespace
  docstrings and this repo's README for full migration context. All 8
  original tests are ported; none were dropped.

  Grid size / step count changes from the originals (all documented inline
  at each test below, with the original Rust values quoted in comments):
  interpreted JVM Clojure without hand-unrolled/AOT numeric code is roughly
  1-2 orders of magnitude slower per lattice-cell-step than native Rust, so
  running the original tests unchanged (some of which simulate hundreds of
  thousands of cells for 1000-3000 steps, i.e. billions of inner-loop
  iterations) would make a single `clojure -M:test` run take tens of
  minutes. The 2D tests keep their original 240x80 grid and only cut step
  counts by roughly half (steady-state wake structure is already resolved
  well before then, and the assertions here are ORDER comparisons, not
  exact absolute Cd values). The two 3D tests that run the LES solver for
  many steps (`high-re-stable-with-les`, `fastback-beats-squareback`,
  `ahmed-slant-reduces-drag`) additionally shrink the domain and body
  proportionally (same blockage ratio, same relative body shape) so the
  physics being demonstrated — LES keeping high-Re BGK stable, fastback
  beating squareback, a slanted rear beating a squareback — is unchanged,
  just at a cheaper cell count. `mesh-voxelises-to-a-solid` and
  `stl-roundtrips` do no LBM stepping at all, so they keep the ORIGINAL
  Rust grid sizes unchanged (voxelisation alone is cheap regardless of grid
  size)."
