  "**Internal** (duct / enclosure / cold-plate) flow on the same D3Q19
  lattice-Boltzmann kernel as `kami-cfd.d3`, but with internal-flow boundary
  conditions instead of the vehicle far-field ones.

  Why this namespace exists. `kami-cfd.d3` solves *external* aerodynamics: a
  body sits in a freestream, the domain sides are free-slip far field, the
  ground is no-slip, and the x-ends are inflow/outflow. That boundary set is
  exactly wrong for a sealed box with a fan: there is no far field, every
  wall is no-slip, and air enters and leaves only through designated patches.
  Reusing `d3/run` on an enclosure would silently model a box floating in a
  wind tunnel with leaky walls.

  What is shared and what is not:
  - **Shared** (from `kami-cfd.d3`): the D3Q19 lattice (`ex`/`ey`/`ez`/`w`/
    `opp`), `feq`, and `collide!` — the BGK + Smagorinsky LES collision.
    Collision is per-cell and reads no neighbour, so it is boundary-agnostic
    by construction and safe to share. One lattice, one source of truth.
  - **Not shared**: streaming and boundaries. This namespace supplies its own
    `stream!` where *all six domain faces are no-slip walls* except the
    patches declared as inlet/outlet.

  Boundary conditions implemented:
  - **Solid cells / walls** — halfway bounce-back (`opp`), the same treatment
    `d3` uses for the body. Second-order accurate for a wall halfway between
    nodes, which is what the Poiseuille validation below relies on.
  - **Velocity inlet** — equilibrium at a prescribed velocity (a fan face).
  - **Outlet** — zero-gradient copy from the neighbour cell one step inside
    (an open vent). Mass is not forced to balance; the outlet lets the solver
    find its own flux.
  - **Periodic axes** — `:periodic #{:x :y :z}`. An out-of-domain upstream on
    a periodic axis wraps to the far side instead of bouncing back. Needed for
    any streamwise-invariant case (the Poiseuille verification below) and for
    repeating geometry. Without it every face is a wall, and a body force in a
    sealed box only pressurises it — which is exactly what the first version
    of this namespace did, and what the verification case caught.
  - **Body force** — optional uniform acceleration, used by the validation
    case (force-driven Poiseuille) and available for buoyancy studies.

  **Validation is not optional here and is not a smoke test.** `poiseuille`
  runs force-driven plane Poiseuille flow, whose steady solution is exactly
  u(y) = (G/(2 nu)) * y * (H - y). `validate-poiseuille` returns the relative
  L2 error against that closed form. This is the canonical LBM verification
  case: if the L2 error is not small, the bounce-back walls or the viscosity
  mapping are wrong and every enclosure number this namespace produces is
  meaningless. Run it before trusting anything else.

  **What this namespace does NOT compute.** Flow only — velocity, volumetric
  flux, stagnant-region fraction. It carries no energy equation, so it cannot
  give component temperatures. The one temperature it does give,
  `bulk-delta-t`, is not a CFD result at all: it is steady-state energy
  conservation on the through-flow (dT = W / (rho*cp*Q)), i.e. how much the
  air heats up on its way through. Junction temperatures need a conjugate
  heat-transfer solver, which this is not.
